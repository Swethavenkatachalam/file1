        <li>2-3 slices of lap cheong (Chinese sausage)</li>

        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>

        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Toppings:</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>Fried shallots (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Rice</h3>
    <p><strong>Wash the rice</strong>: Rinse the jasmine rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and set aside.</p>
    <p><strong>Add the rice to the pot</strong>: Place the washed rice into a clay pot (or a regular pot with a heavy bottom if you don’t have a clay pot). Add the water and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Toppings</h3>
    <p><strong>Prepare the chicken</strong>: In a small bowl, marinate the sliced chicken with soy sauce, oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine, sugar, and minced ginger. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes while you prepare the rice.</p>
    <p><strong>Slice the Chinese sausage</strong>: Thinly slice the lap cheong (Chinese sausage) and the soaked shiitake mushrooms.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Rice and Add Toppings</h3>
    <p><strong>Cook the rice</strong>: Once the water in the clay pot starts boiling, reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the rice cook for about 10 minutes, or until the water is mostly absorbed and the rice is almost cooked.</p>
    <p><strong>Add the toppings</strong>: Gently place the marinated chicken, Chinese sausage slices, and mushrooms on top of the rice. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil around the edges of the rice to help create the crispy bottom layer, known as <em>socarrat</em> or <em>guoba</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Cover and cook</strong>: Cover the pot again and cook on low heat for another 10-15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through, the sausage is heated, and the rice develops a crispy layer at the bottom.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p><strong>Mix the sauce</strong>: In a small bowl, combine light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and water. Stir until the sugar dissolves.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve the Clay Pot Rice</h3>
    <p><strong>Garnish</strong>: Once the rice is fully cooked, remove the pot from the heat and drizzle the sauce evenly over the top. Garnish with chopped green onions and serve with blanched bok choy or leafy greens on the side.</p>
    <p><strong>Mix and enjoy</strong>: Serve the clay pot rice hot, and mix the toppings and sauce into the rice. You can also scrape the crispy rice from the bottom for a crunchy texture.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crispy bottom layer</strong>: To get a crispy bottom layer, control the heat carefully—keep it low, and cook the rice longer after adding the toppings. Avoid stirring during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein variations</strong>: You can substitute the chicken with pork, beef, or shrimp. Some versions of clay pot rice also include salted fish or tofu.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables</strong>: Traditional recipes often include blanched bok choy or other leafy greens, but you can add any vegetables you prefer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This <strong>Cantonese Clay Pot Rice</strong> delivers comforting and flavorful bites with tender meat, savory rice, and a crispy bottom layer, all infused with the rich soy-based sauce. Enjoy this hearty meal!</p>
