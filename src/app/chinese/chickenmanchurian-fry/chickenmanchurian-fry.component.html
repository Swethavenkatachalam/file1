    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare and Fry the Chicken</h3>
    <p><strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong> In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with cornstarch, all-purpose flour, soy sauce, egg, salt, and black pepper. Let it marinate for 15-20 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Fry the chicken:</strong> Heat oil in a pan or deep fryer. Fry the chicken in batches until golden and crispy, about 4-5 minutes per batch. Remove and drain on paper towels.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Manchurian Sauce</h3>
    <p><strong>Sauté aromatics:</strong> In a large wok or pan, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped garlic, ginger, and green chilies, and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.</p>
    <p><strong>Cook the vegetables:</strong> Add the chopped onions and bell peppers to the pan. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened but still crisp.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p><strong>Add the sauces:</strong> Stir in the soy sauce, vinegar, ketchup, chili sauce, sugar, and black or white pepper. Mix well to combine.</p>
    <p><strong>Thicken the sauce:</strong> Add the cornstarch slurry (1 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup water) to the pan and stir continuously until the sauce thickens, about 1-2 minutes. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more water or broth to adjust the consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Chicken with Sauce</h3>
    <p><strong>Toss the chicken:</strong> Add the fried chicken pieces to the sauce and toss well to coat the chicken evenly. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes to absorb the flavors.</p>
    <p><strong>Garnish:</strong> Sprinkle chopped spring onions on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
    <p><strong>Serve hot:</strong> Chicken Manchurian is best served hot with steamed rice, fried rice, or noodles.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crispy chicken:</strong> To keep the chicken crispy, fry it in batches and make sure the oil is hot enough.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjusting the spice level:</strong> If you prefer less heat, reduce or omit the green chilies and chili sauce. For extra heat, add more chili sauce or fresh chilies.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance the sauce:</strong> Adjust the seasoning of the sauce to your taste. You can make it tangier by adding more vinegar or sweeter by increasing the sugar.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This <strong>Chicken Manchurian</strong> combines crispy fried chicken with a tangy, savory sauce, making it a perfect dish to enjoy with rice or noodles for an Indo-Chinese feast!</p>
