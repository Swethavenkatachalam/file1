    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <h3>For the Soup:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>100g (3.5 oz) pork loin or chicken breast, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>1 block (200g) firm tofu, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup bamboo shoots, julienned</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shiitake mushrooms or wood ear mushrooms, soaked and sliced</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar (or black vinegar)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 2 tbsp water (for thickening)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chili oil (or more, to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tsp white pepper (or black pepper)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 green onion, finely chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish, optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p><strong>Soak the mushrooms:</strong> If using dried shiitake or wood ear mushrooms, soak them in warm water for about 20-30 minutes until they soften. Slice thinly.</p>
    <p><strong>Julienne the bamboo shoots:</strong> Drain and thinly slice the bamboo shoots into matchstick-sized pieces.</p>
    <p><strong>Slice the tofu:</strong> Cut the tofu into thin strips for the soup.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Pork (Optional)</h3>
    <p><strong>Sear the pork or chicken:</strong> Heat a small amount of oil in a pot. Add the thinly sliced pork or chicken and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until just cooked. Remove and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Broth</h3>
    <p><strong>Bring the broth to a boil:</strong> In a large pot, bring 6 cups of chicken or vegetable broth to a boil over medium heat.</p>
    <p><strong>Add the vegetables:</strong> Add the sliced mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and tofu strips to the pot. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Season the Soup</h3>
    <p><strong>Soy sauce and vinegar:</strong> Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar (or black vinegar), sugar, and white pepper to the soup. Adjust the level of sourness by adding more vinegar to your taste.</p>
    <p><strong>Add the chili oil:</strong> Stir in chili oil for heat, adjusting the amount based on how spicy you prefer the soup.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Thicken the Soup</h3>
    <p><strong>Cornstarch slurry:</strong> Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water until smooth. Slowly pour this mixture into the soup while stirring constantly to avoid clumping. Let the soup simmer for 1-2 minutes until slightly thickened.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add the Egg</h3>
    <p><strong>Create the egg ribbons:</strong> While the soup is gently simmering, slowly drizzle the beaten egg into the soup in a thin stream. Stir the soup gently in one direction to create delicate egg ribbons.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Finish and Serve</h3>
    <p><strong>Sesame oil:</strong> Add a drizzle of sesame oil for extra flavor.</p>
    <p><strong>Garnish:</strong> Ladle the hot and sour soup into bowls and garnish with finely chopped green onions and fresh cilantro, if desired.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adjust the flavors:</strong> The key to hot and sour soup is balancing the flavors. If it's too spicy, add more vinegar. If it's too sour, add a bit more soy sauce or sugar to mellow it out.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture:</strong> For a thicker soup, increase the cornstarch slurry. For a thinner soup, reduce or omit it.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein variations:</strong> You can add other proteins like shrimp or beef, or keep it vegetarian by skipping the meat entirely.</li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar:</strong> Rice vinegar gives a mild tang, but for a more traditional flavor, use Chinese black vinegar.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This <strong>Chinese-Style Hot and Sour Soup</strong> is a perfect combination of heat and tanginess with a hearty and flavorful broth. It's a comforting dish, ideal for cold days or when you're craving something warming and flavorful!</p>
