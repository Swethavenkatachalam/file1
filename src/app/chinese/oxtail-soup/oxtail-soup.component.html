    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 - 2 lbs (700-900g) oxtail, cut into sections</li>
        <li>8-10 cups water (or beef broth for a richer flavor)</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 large daikon radish, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
        <li>3-4 slices ginger</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>1-2 green onions, tied into a knot</li>
        <li>1-2 star anise</li>
        <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Shaoxing wine (Chinese cooking wine)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce (for color, optional)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp white pepper (or black pepper)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro or green onions for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Blanch the Oxtail</h3>
    <p><strong>Parboil the oxtail:</strong> In a large pot, bring enough water to cover the oxtail to a boil. Add the oxtail and blanch for 5-7 minutes to remove impurities and excess fat.</p>
    <p><strong>Drain and rinse:</strong> Remove the oxtail from the water, drain, and rinse them under cold water. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Aromatics and Vegetables</h3>
    <p><strong>Chop the vegetables:</strong> Cut the carrot, daikon radish, and onion into large chunks.</p>
    <p><strong>Prepare the aromatics:</strong> Smash the garlic cloves and slice the ginger. Tie the green onions into a knot for easier removal later.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Start the Soup</h3>
    <p><strong>Sear the oxtail (optional):</strong> For extra depth of flavor, you can sear the oxtail in a little oil until browned on all sides in a large soup pot. This step is optional but adds more richness to the soup.</p>
    <p><strong>Simmer the oxtail:</strong> In the same pot, add 8-10 cups of water (or beef broth). Add the blanched oxtail, ginger, garlic, onion, green onion knot, star anise, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick.</p>
    <p><strong>Add seasonings:</strong> Pour in Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, and dark soy sauce (if using). Bring everything to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer gently.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Simmer the Soup</h3>
    <p><strong>Long, slow cooking:</strong> Cover the pot and let the soup simmer for 2-3 hours on low heat. Skim off any foam or fat that rises to the surface. The oxtail should become tender, and the broth should be infused with rich flavors.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 5: Add Vegetables</h3>
    <p><strong>Add carrots and daikon:</strong> After 2-3 hours of simmering, add the carrot and daikon chunks to the pot. Continue to cook for another 30-40 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft and the oxtail is fall-off-the-bone tender.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Season and Finish</h3>
    <p><strong>Adjust seasoning:</strong> Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with salt and white pepper as needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Optional step:</strong> If you prefer a clearer broth, strain the soup and remove the aromatics like the ginger, garlic, star anise, cinnamon, and bay leaves.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Serve</h3>
    <p><strong>Serve hot:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls, ensuring each serving has a generous portion of oxtail and vegetables. Garnish with chopped cilantro or green onions for a fresh touch.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Slow cooking:</strong> This recipe is best when cooked slowly over a low flame. The longer you simmer, the more flavorful the soup and tender the oxtail will become.</li>
        <li><strong>Skimming the fat:</strong> Oxtail can be fatty, so skimming off the excess fat during cooking helps to make a lighter broth. Alternatively, refrigerate the soup overnight and remove the solidified fat the next day.</li>
        <li><strong>Variations:</strong> You can add other vegetables like potatoes or tomatoes for extra flavor. You can also add a handful of goji berries or jujube dates for a sweet, herbal note often found in Chinese soups.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This <strong>Chinese-Style Oxtail Soup</strong> is comforting and nourishing, with tender oxtail and rich broth infused with warming spices and aromatics. Perfect for a cozy meal!</p>
