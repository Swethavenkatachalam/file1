    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <h3>For the Rice:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups cooked jasmine rice (day-old or cold rice works best)</li>
        <li>1 small pineapple (or 1 cup fresh pineapple chunks)</li>
        <li>2 eggs (lightly beaten)</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots (or other mixed vegetables)</li>
        <li>2-3 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup roasted cashews or peanuts (optional, for crunch)</li>
        <li>1-2 red chilies, sliced (optional, for heat)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Seasoning:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fish sauce (optional for extra umami)</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp white pepper (or black pepper)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Optional Add-ins:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>150g shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>150g chicken breast, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ham, diced (for a meat version)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pineapple</h3>
    <p><strong>Cut the pineapple:</strong> If using a whole pineapple, slice it in half lengthwise and hollow out one half to use as a bowl. Dice the flesh into small chunks and set aside. You can also use canned pineapple chunks if fresh is unavailable.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Rice</h3>
    <p><strong>Use day-old rice:</strong> Day-old rice works best because it is drier and will fry better. If you're using freshly cooked rice, let it cool down and refrigerate it for a while to firm it up. Fluff the rice to break up any clumps.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Protein (Optional)</h3>
    <p><strong>Shrimp or chicken:</strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp or diced chicken, stir-fry until cooked through (about 3-4 minutes). Remove and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Scramble the Eggs</h3>
    <p><strong>Cook the eggs:</strong> In the same wok or skillet, add a little more oil if necessary. Pour in the beaten eggs and scramble them until just cooked. Remove and set aside with the shrimp or chicken.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Stir-fry the Vegetables</h3>
    <p><strong>Saute onions and garlic:</strong> Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok and stir-fry the chopped onion and minced garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Add vegetables:</strong> Stir in the frozen peas and carrots (or mixed vegetables) and cook for another 2 minutes until softened.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Stir-fry the Rice</h3>
    <p><strong>Add the rice:</strong> Increase the heat to high and add the cooked, fluffed rice to the wok. Stir-fry the rice for 3-4 minutes, breaking up any clumps and allowing it to absorb the flavors.</p>
    <p><strong>Season the rice:</strong> Pour in the soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce (if using), sugar, and white pepper. Stir well to coat the rice evenly with the seasoning.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Add Pineapple and Toppings</h3>
    <p><strong>Add pineapple chunks:</strong> Gently stir in the pineapple chunks, scrambled eggs, and cooked shrimp or chicken. Toss everything together until well combined.</p>
    <p><strong>Green onions and nuts:</strong> Add chopped green onions and roasted cashews or peanuts for crunch. Toss gently to mix.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Serve</h3>
    <p><strong>Serve in the pineapple bowl:</strong> If you hollowed out a pineapple, spoon the fried rice into the pineapple shell for a fun and festive presentation. Garnish with extra green onions or sliced chilies.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cold rice works best:</strong> Using day-old or refrigerated rice helps prevent it from becoming mushy when stir-frying.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweet and savory balance:</strong> The sweetness of pineapple should complement the savory flavors of soy sauce and oyster sauce. Adjust seasoning as needed to balance the dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein options:</strong> This recipe works well with shrimp, chicken, ham, or even tofu for a vegetarian version.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This <strong>Chinese-style Pineapple Fried Rice</strong> is a flavorful and vibrant dish, combining the freshness of pineapple with savory stir-fried rice, vegetables, and your choice of protein. It's perfect as a main or side dish!</p>
