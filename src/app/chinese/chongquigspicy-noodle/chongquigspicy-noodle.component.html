    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Sauce Base</h3>
    <p><strong>Mix the sauce</strong>: In a large serving bowl, combine chili oil with sediment, ground Sichuan peppercorns, Chinese black vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, minced garlic, doubanjiang, and Shaoxing wine. Stir well to create a smooth, spicy sauce base.</p>
    <p><strong>Adjust the consistency</strong>: Add the chicken broth or hot water to adjust the sauce to your desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Noodles</h3>
    <p><strong>Boil the noodles</strong>: Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Fresh noodles will take only 2-3 minutes, while dried noodles will take around 4-5 minutes. Drain the noodles and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Meat (Optional)</h3>
    <p><strong>Cook the ground pork or beef</strong>: Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the ground meat and cook until browned and crispy.</p>
    <p><strong>Add seasonings</strong>: Stir in soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and crushed Sichuan peppercorns, cooking for another 3-5 minutes until the meat is well seasoned. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Toppings</h3>
    <p><strong>Blanch the greens</strong>: Blanch the leafy greens (like bok choy or spinach) in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, then drain and set aside.</p>
    <p><strong>Chop garnishes</strong>: Prepare the chopped green onions, cilantro, and toasted peanuts or sesame seeds for topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Chongqing Spicy Noodles</h3>
    <p><strong>Add the noodles</strong>: Place the cooked noodles in the bowl with the sauce.</p>
    <p><strong>Top with meat</strong>: If using, spoon the cooked ground meat over the noodles.</p>
    <p><strong>Add vegetables</strong>: Place the blanched greens on top, along with any other garnishes like green onions, cilantro, toasted peanuts, or sesame seeds.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
    <p><strong>Mix and enjoy</strong>: Before eating, toss the noodles well with the sauce and toppings to coat everything evenly. Adjust the seasoning with extra chili oil or vinegar, if desired.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adjust spice level</strong>: You can control the heat by adjusting the amount of chili oil and doubanjiang. Add more or less according to your preference.</li>
        <li><strong>Noodle texture</strong>: Be sure to cook the noodles just until al dente and rinse with cold water if they need to wait a few minutes before serving, to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom toppings</strong>: Feel free to customize the toppings by adding tofu, fried egg, or different types of vegetables.</li>
    </ul>
