    <p><strong>Napa Cabbage</strong> (also known as Chinese cabbage, <em>大白菜</em>) is a versatile vegetable often used in Chinese cuisine for stir-fries, soups, or dumpling fillings. Here’s a simple and delicious recipe for <strong>Chinese-Style Stir-Fried Napa Cabbage</strong> that highlights the vegetable’s natural sweetness and tender-crisp texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium napa cabbage (about 500g)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3-4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2-3 slices of ginger</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp white pepper (or black pepper)</li>
        <li>1-2 red chilies, sliced (optional, for heat)</li>
        <li>Chopped green onions for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Napa Cabbage</h3>
    <p><strong>Cut the cabbage:</strong> Remove any damaged outer leaves of the napa cabbage. Cut the cabbage lengthwise into quarters, then slice into 2-3 inch pieces, separating the white stems from the leafy green tops. The stems need a little more time to cook than the leaves.</p>
    <p><strong>Rinse and drain:</strong> Wash the napa cabbage thoroughly under cold water and drain well.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p><strong>Mix the sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and water or vegetable stock. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Heat the Oil</h3>
    <p><strong>Heat the wok:</strong> In a large wok or skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.</p>
    <p><strong>Add garlic and ginger:</strong> Add the minced garlic and ginger slices to the wok, stir-frying for about 30 seconds to 1 minute until fragrant but not browned.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Stir-Fry the Napa Cabbage Stems</h3>
    <p><strong>Cook the white stems first:</strong> Add the thicker white stems of the napa cabbage to the wok first, as they take longer to cook than the leafy tops. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the stems are starting to soften but still have a bit of crunch.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Leafy Green Tops</h3>
    <p><strong>Add the leaves:</strong> Now add the leafy green tops of the napa cabbage to the wok. Stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes until the leaves are just wilted but still vibrant in color.</p>
    <p><strong>Pour in the sauce:</strong> Pour the prepared soy sauce mixture over the cabbage and stir well to coat all the pieces evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Simmer and Finish</h3>
    <p><strong>Simmer:</strong> Let the cabbage cook in the sauce for another 1-2 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the cabbage to soften to your preferred texture.</p>
    <p><strong>Add finishing touches:</strong> Drizzle with a little sesame oil and sprinkle white pepper for extra flavor. If you like heat, toss in the sliced red chilies at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Serve</h3>
    <p><strong>Serve immediately:</strong> Transfer the stir-fried napa cabbage to a serving dish. Garnish with chopped green onions, if desired, and serve hot as a side dish with rice or as part of a larger Chinese meal.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crisp texture:</strong> Avoid overcooking the napa cabbage to keep the white stems slightly crisp while the leaves are tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance the flavors:</strong> Adjust the seasoning to your taste—add a little more soy sauce for saltiness, or sugar to balance the dish's flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein add-ins:</strong> You can add sliced mushrooms, tofu, or small pieces of meat like pork or chicken to make this dish more filling.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This <strong>Chinese-Style Stir-Fried Napa Cabbage</strong> is quick, nutritious, and flavorful, making it an excellent side dish for any meal. Enjoy the tender crunch of the napa cabbage paired with savory and aromatic seasonings!</p>
