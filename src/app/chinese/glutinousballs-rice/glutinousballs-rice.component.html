    <h1>Glutinous Rice Balls (汤圆) Recipe</h1>
    <p><strong>Glutinous Rice Balls (汤圆, Tāngyuán)</strong> are a traditional Chinese dessert made from glutinous rice flour, often filled with sweet fillings like sesame paste, peanut butter, or red bean paste. These sticky, chewy rice balls are typically served in a light, sweet soup and are especially popular during festive occasions like Lantern Festival or Winter Solstice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups glutinous rice flour (also called sticky rice flour)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water (or more as needed)</li>
        <li>A few drops of food coloring (optional, for colorful rice balls)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Fillings (Choose One or Mix Several):</h3>

    <h4>1. Black Sesame Filling:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup black sesame seeds, toasted</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lard or butter (melted)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Peanut Filling:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup peanuts, toasted and finely ground</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter or lard (melted)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Red Bean Paste Filling (store-bought or homemade):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup sweet red bean paste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Sweet Soup:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rock sugar (or regular sugar)</li>
        <li>1-2 slices of ginger (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
        <li>1-2 pandan leaves (optional, for fragrance)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Fillings</h3>
    <p><strong>For Black Sesame Filling:</strong> Grind the toasted black sesame seeds into a fine powder using a food processor. Add sugar and melted lard or butter, and mix until a smooth paste forms. Chill in the fridge for 15-20 minutes to firm up.</p>
    <p><strong>For Peanut Filling:</strong> Grind the toasted peanuts into a fine powder. Mix with sugar and melted butter or lard until combined. Chill to firm up before shaping.</p>
    <p><strong>For Red Bean Paste Filling:</strong> If using store-bought red bean paste, ensure it's firm and ready to use. You can refrigerate it to firm it up.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p><strong>Make the dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, gradually add water to the glutinous rice flour while mixing, until a soft and smooth dough forms. The dough should be pliable and not too sticky. If it's too dry, add a little more water; if it's too sticky, add more glutinous rice flour.</p>
    <p><strong>Optional coloring:</strong> If you want colorful glutinous rice balls, divide the dough into portions and add a few drops of food coloring to each portion. Knead until the color is evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Glutinous Rice Balls</h3>
    <p><strong>Form the balls:</strong> Take a small piece of dough (about the size of a ping-pong ball), flatten it in your palm, and place a small amount (about 1 tsp) of filling in the center. Carefully fold the edges of the dough over the filling and pinch it closed, rolling it into a smooth ball. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Glutinous Rice Balls</h3>
    <p><strong>Boil the rice balls:</strong> Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Gently drop the glutinous rice balls into the boiling water, and stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Once the rice balls float to the surface, cook them for another 2-3 minutes to ensure the dough is fully cooked.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Prepare the Sweet Soup</h3>
    <p><strong>Make the soup:</strong> While the rice balls are cooking, in a separate pot, bring 4 cups of water, rock sugar (or regular sugar), ginger slices, and pandan leaves (if using) to a boil. Let it simmer for 5-10 minutes until the sugar is dissolved and the soup is fragrant. Remove the ginger and pandan leaves before serving.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
    <p><strong>Combine and serve:</strong> Once the rice balls are cooked, use a slotted spoon to transfer them into serving bowls. Ladle the sweet soup over the rice balls and serve hot.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Filling consistency:</strong> Make sure the filling is firm enough to shape into small balls. Chilling it in the fridge helps prevent it from being too runny when wrapping the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevent sticking:</strong> Dust your hands with a little glutinous rice flour to prevent the dough from sticking while shaping.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> You can freeze the uncooked rice balls by placing them on a tray lined with parchment paper. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag. Cook directly from frozen, adding an extra minute or two to the cooking time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enjoy your <strong>Glutinous Rice Balls (汤圆)</strong> with their soft, chewy texture and delicious sweet filling, a perfect dessert for special occasions or as a comforting treat!</p>
