    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <h3>For the Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g (9 oz) ground pork (or chicken)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sweet bean sauce (Tian Mian Jiang, 甜面酱)</li>

        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water or chicken broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Noodles:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300g (10 oz) fresh or dried wheat noodles (or other thick noodles)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Toppings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cucumber, julienned</li>
        <li>Carrot, julienned</li>
        <li>Bean sprouts (blanched)</li>
        <li>Green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Meat Sauce</h3>
    <p><strong>Heat the oil</strong>: In a wok or large pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.</p>
    <p><strong>Cook the pork</strong>: Add the ground pork and stir-fry until it turns golden brown and starts to get crispy, breaking it up into small pieces.</p>
    <p><strong>Add the sauces</strong>: Stir in the sweet bean sauce, fermented soybean paste (doubanjiang), soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and sugar. Stir well to coat the pork evenly in the sauce.</p>
    <p><strong>Simmer</strong>: Pour in the water or chicken broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens. Add sesame oil at the end for extra flavor. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Noodles</h3>
    <p><strong>Boil the noodles</strong>: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Fresh noodles will take a couple of minutes, while dried noodles may take 4-5 minutes. Drain the noodles and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Toppings</h3>
    <p><strong>Julienne the vegetables</strong>: Thinly slice the cucumber and carrot into matchsticks. Blanch the bean sprouts briefly in boiling water and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Zha Jiang Mian</h3>
    <p><strong>Divide the noodles</strong>: Place the cooked noodles in individual serving bowls.</p>
    <p><strong>Add the sauce</strong>: Spoon the meat sauce generously over the noodles.</p>
    <p><strong>Garnish</strong>: Add the cucumber, carrot, bean sprouts, green onions, and cilantro on top of the noodles.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
    <p><strong>Mix and enjoy</strong>: To eat, mix the noodles with the sauce and toppings so everything is evenly coated. Serve immediately.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adjust the sauce</strong>: Depending on the saltiness of the bean paste, you may need to adjust the amount of sugar or soy sauce to balance the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture variety</strong>: The crispy cucumber and carrots provide a nice contrast to the savory meat sauce, so don’t skip the fresh toppings.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce consistency</strong>: If the sauce gets too thick, add a bit more water or broth to loosen it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enjoy your <strong>Zha Jiang Mian</strong>, a hearty, savory, and satisfying dish packed with authentic flavors from northern China!</p>
