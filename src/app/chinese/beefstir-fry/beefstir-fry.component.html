    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Marinate the Beef</h3>
    <p><strong>Prepare the beef:</strong> Thinly slice the beef against the grain for tenderness.</p>
    <p><strong>Marinate the beef:</strong> In a bowl, mix the beef with soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, cornstarch, black pepper, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 15-20 minutes to enhance the flavors and tenderize the meat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p><strong>Mix the sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce (optional), sugar, black or white pepper, sesame oil, and the cornstarch slurry. Stir well and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Stir-Fry the Beef</h3>
    <p><strong>Heat the oil:</strong> In a wok or large pan, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over high heat.</p>
    <p><strong>Cook the beef:</strong> Add the marinated beef to the hot wok in a single layer. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the beef is browned and just cooked through. Remove from the wok and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Stir-Fry the Vegetables</h3>
    <p><strong>Add aromatics:</strong> In the same wok, add a bit more oil if needed. Stir-fry the minced garlic and chopped ginger for about 30 seconds until fragrant.</p>
    <p><strong>Cook the vegetables:</strong> Add the sliced onions, bell peppers, and any additional vegetables (like carrots or broccoli). Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they are crisp-tender but still vibrant.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Beef and Sauce</h3>
    <p><strong>Return the beef:</strong> Add the cooked beef back into the wok with the vegetables.</p>
    <p><strong>Add the sauce:</strong> Pour the prepared sauce over the beef and vegetables, stirring to coat everything evenly. Let it simmer for 1-2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p><strong>Garnish:</strong> Sprinkle chopped green onions on top before serving.</p>
    <p><strong>Serve:</strong> This beef stir fry pairs perfectly with steamed white rice, fried rice, or noodles.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef slicing:</strong> For easier slicing, freeze the beef for about 15 minutes before cutting. This helps you achieve thin slices that cook quickly and remain tender.</li>
        <li><strong>High heat:</strong> Stir-frying is best done over high heat to sear the meat and vegetables quickly, preserving their texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize vegetables:</strong> Feel free to use other vegetables like snap peas, mushrooms, or zucchini to personalize your stir fry.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This <strong>Chinese Beef Stir Fry</strong> is a delicious and balanced dish with tender beef, crisp vegetables, and a savory sauce, perfect for a quick and satisfying meal!</p>
