        <li>Crushed peanuts (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the sesame paste, peanut butter (if using), soy sauce, black vinegar, chili oil, sesame oil, sugar, minced garlic, and ground Sichuan peppercorns. Add the chicken or vegetable broth and stir until smooth and well combined. Set the sauce aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Pork Topping</h3>
    <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the ground pork and cook until it starts to brown, breaking it up into small pieces. Add the soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, doubanjiang, and ground Sichuan peppercorns. Stir and cook until the pork is cooked through and well-seasoned, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Noodles</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Fresh noodles will take just a couple of minutes, while dried noodles may take 4-5 minutes. Drain the noodles and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Dan Dan Noodles</h3>
    <p>Divide the prepared sauce between serving bowls. Add the cooked noodles on top of the sauce. Top the noodles with the cooked pork mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Garnish the noodles with chopped green onions, fresh cilantro, and, if desired, crushed peanuts. Toss everything together to coat the noodles in the sauce and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adjust spice level:</strong> Increase or decrease the chili oil and doubanjiang according to your heat tolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance flavors:</strong> Taste the sauce and adjust the salt, sugar, and vinegar to balance the salty, sweet, sour, and spicy elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Broth consistency:</strong> You can adjust the amount of broth for a thinner or thicker sauce, depending on your preference.</li>
    </ul>
