    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Broth</h3>
    <p><strong>Blanch the bones</strong>: In a large pot, cover the pork bones with water and bring to a boil. Boil for 5-10 minutes to remove impurities. Drain the water and rinse the bones.</p>
    <p><strong>Simmer the broth</strong>: Return the bones to the pot and add 2-3 liters of fresh water. Add the ginger slices, onion, star anise, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, Shaoxing wine, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for at least 2 hours to develop a rich flavor. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Rice Noodles</h3>
    <p><strong>Prepare the noodles</strong>: If using dried rice noodles, soak them in warm water for 20-30 minutes until softened, then boil for 2-3 minutes. If using fresh noodles, boil them for just 1-2 minutes. Drain and rinse the noodles under cold water to stop the cooking process.</p>
