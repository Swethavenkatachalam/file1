        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Coffee Mixture</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Brew 1 1/2 cups of strong espresso and let it cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Stir in 2 tablespoons of coffee liqueur (optional) and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Make the Mascarpone Cream</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heatproof bowl, combine 4 egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) and whisk constantly for about 5-7 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and becomes pale yellow.</li>
            <li>Remove the egg mixture from heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whip 1 cup heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, gently whisk 1 1/4 cups mascarpone cheese until smooth. Fold the cooled egg mixture into the mascarpone until combined.</li>
            <li>Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture, ensuring the mixture stays light and airy.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Tiramisu</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Quickly dip the Savoiardi (ladyfingers) into the cooled coffee mixture, one at a time. Do not soak them. Place a layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x9 inch (or similar) dish.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture evenly over the layer of ladyfingers.</li>
            <li>Add another layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers on top of the mascarpone cream. Then, spread the remaining mascarpone cream on top.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.</li>
            <li>Before serving, dust the top generously with unsweetened cocoa powder. Optionally, add dark chocolate shavings for extra richness.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve the tiramisu chilled.</li>
        </ol>

            <li><strong>Egg Safety:</strong> Ensure the egg yolks are cooked safely, or use pasteurized eggs if preferred.</li>
