        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="step-title">Step 1: Prepare the Dough</li>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
                <li><strong>Cream butter and sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, beat the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Add eggs and flavorings:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract and almond extract (if using).</li>
                <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Fold in blueberries:</strong> Gently fold in the dried blueberries and slivered almonds (if using). If adding lemon zest, fold it in as well.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 2: Shape the Biscotti</li>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it in half. Shape each half into a log about 10-12 inches long and 2-3 inches wide. Transfer the logs onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li><strong>Flatten slightly:</strong> Gently press down on the tops of the logs to slightly flatten them.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 3: First Bake</li>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bake the logs:</strong> Bake the logs in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the logs are lightly golden and firm to the touch.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool slightly:</strong> Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the logs to cool for about 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300°F (150°C).</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 4: Slice and Second Bake</li>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Slice the logs:</strong> Once the logs have cooled slightly, use a sharp serrated knife to slice them diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices.</li>
                <li><strong>Second bake:</strong> Place the biscotti slices cut-side down on the baking sheet and return them to the oven. Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes on each side, or until the biscotti are dry and crispy.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 5: Cool and Serve</li>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cool completely:</strong> Allow the biscotti to cool completely on a wire rack. They will continue to harden as they cool.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the biscotti with coffee, tea, or as a snack on their own.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Twice Baking:</strong> The second bake is essential to give biscotti their characteristic crunchy texture. Adjust the time based on how crispy you like them.</li>
            <li><strong>Dried Fruit:</strong> If you can’t find dried blueberries, dried cranberries or cherries are excellent substitutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store biscotti in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks. They also freeze well.</li>
        </ul>
