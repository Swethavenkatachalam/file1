        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="step-title">Step 1: Prepare the Dough</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually add the yeast mixture, mixing with a wooden spoon or your hands.</li>
                <li>Add the olive oil and continue mixing until the dough starts to come together.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise for 1.5-2 hours until it doubles in size.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 2: Prepare the Tomato Sauce</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour the canned San Marzano tomatoes into a bowl and crush by hand or blend for a smooth sauce.</li>
                <li>Optional: Cook the crushed tomatoes in a saucepan over low heat for 10-15 minutes to reduce excess liquid.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 3: Shape the Pizza</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to the highest setting (250°C/480°F or higher) for at least 30 minutes. Place a pizza stone in the oven if you have one.</li>
                <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two or more portions.</li>
                <li>On a floured surface, stretch each dough ball by hand or roll into a thin, round pizza base (10-12 inches).</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 4: Assemble the Pizza</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the pizza base, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
                <li>Tear fresh mozzarella into pieces and scatter evenly over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add fresh basil leaves and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 5: Bake the Pizza</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Bake in the oven (or on a pizza stone) for 8-10 minutes, until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Optional: Broil the pizza for 1-2 minutes for an extra crispy crust.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 6: Serve</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, garnish with fresh basil leaves, and let it cool slightly before slicing.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
