        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Cook the Vermicelli</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the vermicelli and cook according to the package instructions until al dente, usually 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Tomato and Garlic Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the thinly sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant and golden. Be careful not to let it burn.</li>
            <li>Add the halved cherry tomatoes (or chopped Roma tomatoes) to the skillet. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the tomatoes soften and release their juices.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir occasionally and let the sauce simmer for 5-6 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the cooked vermicelli directly into the skillet with the tomato and garlic sauce.</li>
            <li>Gently toss the pasta in the sauce, ensuring it's well coated. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water to thin it out and help the sauce cling to the pasta.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Season and Garnish</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir in the chopped basil and parsley for a fresh, aromatic flavor.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust with more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
            <li>Optionally, sprinkle grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese over the top and add a touch of lemon zest for brightness.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Transfer the vermicelli to plates or a large serving dish.</li>
            <li>Drizzle a bit more extra virgin olive oil over the pasta just before serving for extra richness.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use fresh ingredients:</strong> The simplicity of this dish relies on the freshness of the tomatoes, garlic, and herbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Al dente pasta:</strong> Vermicelli is a thin pasta, so keep an eye on it while cooking to prevent it from becoming too soft.</li>
            <li><strong>Add proteins:</strong> You can also add shrimp, chicken, or anchovies to make the dish heartier.</li>
