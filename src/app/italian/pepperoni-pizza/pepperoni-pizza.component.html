        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="step-title">Step 1: Prepare the Dough</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Slowly add the yeast mixture to the flour while mixing with a wooden spoon or hands. Add the olive oil and continue mixing until the dough comes together.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise for 1.5-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 2: Prepare the Tomato Sauce</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Crush or blend the canned San Marzano tomatoes. Add a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil for extra flavor.</li>
                <li>Optional: For a thicker sauce, cook the crushed tomatoes in a saucepan over low heat for about 10-15 minutes to reduce some of the liquid.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 3: Shape the Pizza</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to its highest setting (usually around 250°C/480°F) for at least 30 minutes. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
                <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two or more portions, depending on the desired size. On a floured surface, stretch each portion by hand to form a thin, round pizza base, about 10-12 inches in diameter.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 4: Assemble the Pizza</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the pizza base, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
                <li>Distribute the slices or torn pieces of fresh mozzarella evenly over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Place the slices of spicy salami (salame piccante) over the cheese.</li>
                <li>Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the top, and season with a pinch of salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if desired).</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 5: Bake the Pizza</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Transfer the pizza onto a preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake in the hot oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden, the cheese is bubbly, and the salami is slightly crisp around the edges.</li>
                <li>If you want extra crispiness, you can broil the pizza for the last 1-2 minutes of baking.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 6: Serve</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and garnish with fresh basil leaves (optional).</li>
                <li>Slice the pizza and enjoy immediately.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use quality salami:</strong> Italian spicy salami or salsiccia piccante is key to getting that authentic flavor. Look for thinly sliced, high-quality varieties.</li>
            <li><strong>Pizza stone:</strong> If you have a pizza stone, it helps mimic a traditional wood-fired oven, giving the pizza a crispier crust.</li>
            <li><strong>High oven temperature:</strong> Make sure your oven is as hot as possible to replicate the traditional Neapolitan-style pizza.</li>
        </ul>
