        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="step-title">Step 1: Prepare the Risotto</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Sauté the Aromatics: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Toast the Rice: Add 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until the rice edges become translucent, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Deglaze with Wine: Pour in 1/2 cup dry white wine and cook, stirring, until the wine is mostly absorbed.</li>
                <li>Add Stock Gradually: Begin adding the hot stock, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to your desired level of doneness, about 18-20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Finish the Risotto: Stir in 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese and 2 tablespoons unsalted butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 2: Cook the Scallops</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Scallops: Pat the scallops dry with paper towels to ensure a good sear. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Sear the Scallops: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil and butter are hot and shimmering, add the scallops. Sear the scallops for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they develop a golden-brown crust and are cooked through but still tender.</li>
                <li>Add Garlic and Lemon: Add 1 minced garlic clove to the pan during the last minute of cooking, stirring to combine. Drizzle 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice over the scallops, then remove them from the pan and set aside.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 3: Serve</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Plate the Risotto: Spoon the creamy risotto onto plates or into bowls.</li>
                <li>Top with Scallops: Arrange the seared scallops on top of the risotto.</li>
                <li>Garnish: Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, lemon zest, and additional Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve Immediately: Serve the scallop risotto while hot and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Fresh Scallops:</strong> For the best flavor and texture, use fresh, high-quality sea scallops. Avoid pre-frozen scallops if possible, as they can be less tender.</li>
            <li><strong>Properly Dry Scallops:</strong> Patting the scallops dry before searing is crucial for achieving a nice, caramelized crust.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Stirring:</strong> Stirring the risotto constantly helps release the rice’s starch, creating a creamy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain Warm Stock:</strong> Keep the stock warm on the stove while making the risotto. Adding cold stock can slow down the cooking process.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust Consistency:</strong> If the risotto becomes too thick, you can add a bit more stock or warm water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        </ul>
