        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="step-title">Step 1: Prepare the Lobster</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lobsters and cook for about 8-10 minutes, or until the shells turn bright red. Remove the lobsters and transfer them to an ice bath to stop the cooking. Let them cool.</li>
                <li>Once cool, remove the lobster meat from the shells. You can save the shells for making lobster stock if desired. Cut the lobster meat into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 2: Prepare the Lobster Stock</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Make lobster stock (optional): If you have lobster shells, simmer them with 4 cups water and 1/2 cup white wine for about 30 minutes to make a flavorful stock. Strain and use this stock in place of or in addition to seafood stock.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 3: Make the Risotto</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Sauté the Aromatics: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Toast the Rice: Add 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until the edges of the rice become translucent, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Deglaze with Wine: Pour in 1/2 cup dry white wine and cook, stirring, until the wine is mostly absorbed.</li>
                <li>Add Saffron: In a small bowl, dissolve 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads in 1/4 cup hot stock and stir into the rice mixture.</li>
                <li>Add Stock Gradually: Begin adding the hot stock, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to your desired level of doneness, about 18-20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Finish the Risotto: Stir in 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese and 2 tablespoons unsalted butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 4: Prepare the Lobster</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Sauté the Lobster Meat: In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter over medium heat. Add 2 cloves minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant. Add the lobster meat and cook for 2-3 minutes, then deglaze with 1/2 cup white wine. Allow it to reduce slightly.</li>
                <li>Combine with Risotto: Gently fold the cooked lobster meat into the finished risotto.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 5: Serve</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Plate the Risotto: Spoon the saffron risotto with lobster onto plates or into bowls.</li>
                <li>Garnish: Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil if desired. Optionally, add a few extra shavings of Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Fresh Lobster:</strong> Fresh lobster meat will give the dish the best flavor. If using frozen lobster, ensure it is properly thawed and well-drained.</li>
            <li><strong>Stir Constantly:</strong> Stirring the risotto frequently helps release the rice’s starch, creating a creamy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain Warm Stock:</strong> Keep the stock warm on the stove while making the risotto. Adding cold stock can slow down the cooking process.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust Consistency:</strong> If the risotto becomes too thick, you can add a bit more stock or warm water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Overcooking:</strong> Be careful not to overcook the risotto or lobster. The risotto should be creamy and the lobster should be tender but not rubbery.</li>
        </ul>
