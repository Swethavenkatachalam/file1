        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="step-title">Step 1: Prepare the Yeast</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, dissolve <strong>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</strong> in <strong>1/2 cup warm milk</strong> (110°F/45°C). Stir in <strong>1 tablespoon of honey</strong> and let it sit for <strong>5-10 minutes</strong>, or until the mixture becomes frothy.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 2: Make the Dough</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine <strong>3 cups of all-purpose flour</strong>, <strong>1/3 cup granulated sugar</strong>, and <strong>1/2 teaspoon salt</strong>. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In another bowl, whisk together <strong>2 large eggs</strong>, <strong>2 large egg yolks</strong>, <strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</strong>, <strong>1 teaspoon lemon zest</strong>, and <strong>1 teaspoon orange zest</strong>.</li>
                <li>Add the activated yeast mixture and the egg mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir until it forms a sticky dough.</li>
                <li>Gradually add in <strong>1/2 cup softened unsalted butter</strong>, one tablespoon at a time, mixing continuously. Knead by hand or use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment until the dough is smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky, about <strong>10-15 minutes</strong>.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 3: Add the Fruits</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Drain the soaked raisins or currants, and pat them dry with a paper towel. Toss with a bit of flour to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Gently fold in the <strong>raisins</strong>, <strong>candied orange peel</strong>, and <strong>dried cranberries</strong> (if using) into the dough until evenly distributed.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 4: First Rise</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about <strong>1.5 to 2 hours</strong>, or until it doubles in size.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 5: Shape the Mini Panettones</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Use mini panettone paper molds or muffin tins lined with parchment paper. Lightly grease them.</li>
                <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into equal portions (about <strong>6-8 pieces</strong>, depending on the size of your molds). Shape each portion into a smooth ball and place them into the prepared molds, filling them about halfway.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 6: Second Rise</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Cover the mini panettones with a clean kitchen towel and allow them to rise again in a warm spot for about <strong>45 minutes to 1 hour</strong>, or until the dough has puffed up and nearly reaches the top of the molds.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 7: Bake the Mini Panettones</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to <strong>350°F (175°C)</strong>.</li>
                <li>Lightly brush the tops of the mini panettones with the <strong>egg yolk and milk mixture</strong> for a shiny, golden finish.</li>
                <li>Bake for about <strong>20-25 minutes</strong>, or until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If they brown too quickly, you can tent them with aluminum foil halfway through the baking time.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 8: Cool and Serve</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Once baked, remove the mini panettones from the oven and allow them to cool on a wire rack.</li>
                <li>Serve your mini panettones slightly warm or at room temperature. They can be enjoyed plain, with butter, or alongside a cup of coffee or tea.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dough Texture:</strong> Panettone dough is rich and slightly sticky due to the butter and eggs. Make sure to knead it well until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li><strong>Add-ins:</strong> Feel free to customize the fruit mix. You can use chocolate chips, nuts, or other dried fruits if you prefer.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store the mini panettones in an airtight container for up to 4 days. They also freeze well; wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and store in a freezer-safe bag for up to 1 month.</li>
