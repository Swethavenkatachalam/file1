        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="step-title">Step 1: Prepare the Blackberry Purée</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small saucepan, combine 2 cups blackberries, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Cook over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes until the blackberries break down and the mixture thickens slightly.</li>
                <li>Transfer the cooked blackberries to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Strain the purée through a fine-mesh sieve to remove seeds and set aside to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 2: Prepare the Egg Mixture</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Set up a double boiler: Bring a small pot of water to a simmer. In a heatproof bowl, combine 3 large eggs, 3 large egg yolks, and 1 cup granulated sugar.</li>
                <li>Place the bowl over the simmering water and whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and becomes pale, about 5-7 minutes (it should reach 160°F/70°C). Remove from heat and continue whisking for 2-3 minutes to cool slightly. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and set aside to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 3: Whip the Cream</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, whip 1 1/2 cups chilled heavy cream with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. If using mascarpone cheese, fold in 1/2 cup for extra richness.</li>
                <li>Gently fold the cooled egg mixture into the whipped cream until well combined.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 4: Assemble the Semifreddo</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Gently fold 2/3 of the blackberry purée into the semifreddo mixture to create a marbled effect. Reserve the remaining purée for serving.</li>
                <li>Line a loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving some overhang. Pour the semifreddo mixture into the pan, smooth the top, and cover with plastic wrap. Freeze for at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
            </ol>

            <li class="step-title">Step 5: Serve</li>
            <ol>
                <li>When ready to serve, remove the semifreddo from the freezer and unmold it by lifting it out of the pan using the plastic wrap. Place it on a serving platter.</li>
                <li>Drizzle the remaining blackberry purée over the top, garnish with fresh blackberries, mint leaves, and a dusting of powdered sugar if desired. Slice and serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Egg Safety:</strong> Ensure the egg mixture is cooked to 160°F (70°C) to safely eliminate any risk from raw eggs.</li>
            <li><strong>Whipping the Cream:</strong> Avoid overwhipping the cream. You want soft peaks for a light, airy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Folding Technique:</strong> Use a gentle folding motion when incorporating the egg mixture and blackberry purée to preserve the airiness of the semifreddo.</li>
            <li><strong>Serving:</strong> Allow the semifreddo to sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes before slicing for the best texture.</li>
        </ul>
