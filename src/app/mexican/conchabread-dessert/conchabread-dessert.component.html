        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Activate the yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the warm milk and 1 tbsp of sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, remaining sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, vanilla extract, and softened butter until well combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine ingredients:</strong> Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the yeast mixture and the egg mixture. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
            <li><strong>Knead the dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic, or use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment.</li>
            <li><strong>First rise:</strong> Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Topping</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the topping:</strong> In a medium bowl, beat together the softened butter and sugar until creamy. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, and mix until combined. For chocolate topping, add cocoa powder.</li>
            <li><strong>Chill the topping:</strong> Divide the topping into 2-3 portions if you’re making different flavors. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Shape the Conchas</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into 12-16 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a round ball and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the topping:</strong> Roll out or flatten the chilled topping into circles slightly larger than the dough balls. Place a piece of topping on each dough ball and use a knife or a special concha cutter to create a shell pattern on the topping.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Second Rise</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Second rise:</strong> Cover the dough balls with a damp cloth and let them rise again for 30-45 minutes, or until slightly puffed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Bake the Conchas</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the conchas for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. The topping should be cracked, and the bread should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the conchas to cool on a wire rack before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dough Rising:</strong> Make sure to give the dough ample time to rise. A warm, draft-free environment helps the dough rise better.</li>
            <li><strong>Topping Texture:</strong> The topping should be firm but pliable. If it’s too soft, it may not hold its shape during baking.</li>
            <li><strong>Flavor Variations:</strong> Experiment with different flavors for the topping by adding spices or extracts to suit your taste.</li>
        </ul>
