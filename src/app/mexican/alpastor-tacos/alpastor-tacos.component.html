        <li>1/4 cup pineapple juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp adobo sauce (from canned chipotles in adobo)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Serving:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Warm tortillas (corn or flour)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>Diced onions</li>
        <li>Pineapple slices, grilled or fresh</li>
        <li>Lime wedges</li>
        <li>Salsa or pico de gallo</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Marinade</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Combine marinade ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, mix together the pineapple juice, white vinegar, adobo sauce, minced garlic, ground cumin, paprika, dried oregano, ground coriander, ground cinnamon, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Marinate the Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Add chicken to marinade:</strong> Cut the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces or leave them whole if preferred. Add the chicken to the marinade, ensuring it is well-coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate:</strong> Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 4 hours for the best flavor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat grill or skillet:</strong> Heat a grill or large skillet over medium-high heat. If using a grill, brush the grates with oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the chicken:</strong> Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the excess marinade. Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes per side on the grill, or 7-10 minutes in the skillet, until the chicken is cooked through and has a nice char. Internal temperature should reach 75°C (165°F).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Pineapple</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Grill the pineapple:</strong> If using fresh pineapple, cut it into rings and grill for about 2-3 minutes per side until caramelized. Alternatively, you can use canned pineapple slices, but grilling adds extra flavor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble and Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Slice the chicken:</strong> Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes, then slice or chop it into small pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm tortillas:</strong> Warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble tacos:</strong> Place the chicken in the tortillas and top with fresh cilantro, diced onions, and grilled pineapple. Serve with lime wedges and salsa or pico de gallo on the side.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Marinate time:</strong> Marinating the chicken for at least 1 hour enhances the flavor, but longer marination (up to 4 hours) will give even better results.</li>
        <li><strong>Grilling:</strong> For added authenticity, use a grill to get that classic charred flavor. If using a skillet, you can achieve a good sear by cooking over high heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Pineapple:</strong> The pineapple adds sweetness and a tropical flavor that complements the spices. Grilling the pineapple caramelizes its sugars and enhances its flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Al Pastor Chicken</strong> is a flavorful, versatile dish that can be enjoyed in tacos, burritos, or on its own with your favorite sides. Enjoy the vibrant flavors of Mexican cuisine with this delicious recipe!</p>
