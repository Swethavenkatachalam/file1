        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cake</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking dish or line it with parchment paper.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Cream butter and sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li><strong>Add eggs:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the cake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Tres Leches Mixture</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Combine milks:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and whole milk or heavy cream. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Soak the Cake</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Poke holes:</strong> Once the cake has cooled slightly, use a fork or a skewer to poke holes all over the surface of the cake.</li>
            <li><strong>Pour the milk mixture:</strong> Slowly pour the tres leches mixture over the cake, making sure to evenly distribute it so that the entire cake absorbs the milk mixture. Allow the cake to soak for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight, in the refrigerator.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Topping</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Whip the cream:</strong> In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the heavy cream, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li><strong>Frost the cake:</strong> Spread the whipped cream evenly over the top of the soaked cake.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Garnish:</strong> Optionally, top with fresh fruit or additional decorations.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Cut into squares and serve chilled.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cake Moisture:</strong> Make sure the cake is completely cooled before adding the tres leches mixture to prevent it from falling apart.</li>
            <li><strong>Whipping Cream:</strong> For a lighter topping, you can also add a bit of cream cheese to the whipped cream.</li>
        </ul>
