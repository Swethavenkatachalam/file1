        <li>2 tbsp apple cider vinegar or white vinegar</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Serving:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Corn or flour tortillas</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>Diced onions</li>
        <li>Lime wedges</li>

        <li>Radishes, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>Avocado slices (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chiles</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Toast the chiles:</strong> Heat a dry skillet over medium heat. Add the dried guajillo, ancho, and pasilla chiles. Toast them for about 1-2 minutes, turning occasionally, until they become fragrant. Be careful not to burn them.</li>
        <li><strong>Soak the chiles:</strong> Remove the stems and seeds from the chiles. Place the chiles in a bowl and cover with hot water. Soak for about 15 minutes, or until softened.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Chile Paste</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Blend the chiles:</strong> Drain the chiles and place them in a blender. Add 1 cup of the soaking water, and blend until smooth. You may need to add more water if the paste is too thick. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Meat</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sear the meat:</strong> In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef chunks and sear until browned on all sides. Remove the meat and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the aromatics:</strong> In the same pot, add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Add spices:</strong> Stir in the ground cumin, dried oregano, smoked paprika, dried thyme, black pepper, ground cinnamon, and ground cloves. Cook for 1-2 minutes to bloom the spices.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the chile paste:</strong> Stir in the prepared chile paste and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add broth and tomatoes:</strong> Pour in the beef broth and tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Return the meat:</strong> Add the seared beef chunks back into the pot. Add the bay leaves and apple cider vinegar. Stir to combine.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 5: Simmer</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the birria:</strong> Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and easily shreds with a fork.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 6: Shred the Meat</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Shred the meat:</strong> Once the meat is tender, remove it from the pot and shred it using two forks. Return the shredded meat to the pot and stir to combine.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 7: Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare tortillas:</strong> Warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve the birria:</strong> Ladle the birria into bowls. Serve with warm tortillas on the side. Garnish with fresh cilantro, diced onions, lime wedges, and optional toppings like salsa, radishes, and avocado slices.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chiles:</strong> Adjust the type and quantity of chiles to suit your taste. You can use more or less depending on your preferred level of heat and smokiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> Beef chuck or brisket are commonly used, but you can also use goat or lamb for a more traditional flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Acidity:</strong> The vinegar adds a nice tanginess. You can adjust the amount to taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Birria</strong> is a rich and flavorful stew that's perfect for any occasion. The combination of tender meat, spicy and savory broth, and fresh garnishes makes it a true Mexican classic. Enjoy!</p>
