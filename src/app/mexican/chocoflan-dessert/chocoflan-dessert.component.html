        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cake Batter</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil, eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the batter:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Stir in the hot water; the batter will be thin.</li>
            <li><strong>Add mix-ins:</strong> Fold in the chopped nuts, dried fruit, and chocolate chips or chunks.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Bake the Cake</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pour batter:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Ganache (Optional)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Heat cream:</strong> In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it begins to simmer.</li>
            <li><strong>Add chocolate:</strong> Place the chocolate chips or chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let it sit for a few minutes. Stir until smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the ganache to cool slightly before spreading it over the cooled cake.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Frost and Garnish</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Frost the cake:</strong> Once the cake has cooled completely, spread the ganache over the top and sides of the cake, if using.</li>
            <li><strong>Garnish:</strong> Garnish with additional chopped nuts, chocolate shavings, or a sprinkle of powdered sugar, if desired.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mix-ins:</strong> Customize the cake with your favorite nuts, dried fruits, or even chopped candy for added texture and flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Ganache:</strong> The ganache is optional but adds a rich and decadent touch. If you prefer a simpler cake, dust it with powdered sugar or cocoa powder instead.</li>
