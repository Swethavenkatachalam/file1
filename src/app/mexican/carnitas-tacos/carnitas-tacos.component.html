    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <h3>For the Chicken:</h3>

        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth (or water)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh orange juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Serving:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Warm tortillas (flour or corn)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>Diced onions</li>
        <li>Sliced radishes</li>
        <li>Lime wedges</li>
        <li>Salsa or pico de gallo</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Season the chicken:</strong> Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season them with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sauté aromatics:</strong> Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until the onion is translucent, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown the chicken:</strong> Add the chicken thighs to the skillet and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side until browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Add spices:</strong> Sprinkle the cumin, chili powder, paprika, dried oregano, smoked paprika (if using), and cayenne pepper (if using) over the chicken. Stir to coat the chicken evenly with the spices.</li>
        <li><strong>Add liquids:</strong> Pour in the chicken broth and fresh orange juice. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3: Shred the Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Shred the chicken:</strong> Remove the chicken thighs from the skillet and place them on a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Return the shredded chicken to the skillet.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4: Reduce the Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Simmer to thicken:</strong> Increase the heat to medium-high and cook the chicken uncovered for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the liquid reduces and thickens slightly. Stir occasionally to ensure the chicken doesn’t stick to the pan.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 5: Finish the Carnitas</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Add lime juice:</strong> Stir in the lime juice for a fresh, tangy flavor. Adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the tortillas:</strong> Warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Serve the shredded chicken carnitas in warm tortillas, topped with fresh cilantro, diced onions, sliced radishes, and a squeeze of lime juice. Add salsa or pico de gallo for extra flavor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken thighs:</strong> Using bone-in, skinless chicken thighs will give the carnitas a richer flavor and more moisture. You can use boneless thighs for convenience if preferred.</li>
        <li><strong>Crispy texture:</strong> For a crispy texture, you can spread the shredded chicken in a single layer on a baking sheet and broil it for a few minutes until the edges are crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor variations:</strong> Feel free to experiment with additional spices like ground coriander or a splash of beer for a different flavor profile.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Carnitas de Pollo</strong> is a flavorful and versatile dish that brings a taste of Mexican cuisine to your table, perfect for tacos, burritos, or simply enjoyed with your favorite sides. Enjoy!</p>
