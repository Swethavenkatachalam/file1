    <ul>
        <li>4 large flour tortillas (12-inch or larger)</li>
        <li>1 cup Mexican-style rice (cooked with tomato, garlic, and cumin)</li>
        <li>1 can (15 oz) pinto beans or black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a Mexican blend)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup guacamole</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salsa or pico de gallo</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded lettuce (optional)</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño, sliced (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Marinate the Carne Asada</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the marinade:</strong> In a bowl, mix olive oil, minced garlic, lime juice, cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, pepper, and cilantro. Add the thinly sliced steak to the marinade and mix well. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the fridge for more flavor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Carne Asada</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Grill or pan-fry the steak:</strong> Heat a grill or large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the steak for about 2-3 minutes per side until it’s seared and cooked to your desired doneness.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and slice:</strong> Remove the steak from the heat and let it rest for 5 minutes. Slice the steak into thin strips or bite-sized pieces.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Other Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the rice:</strong> Prepare Mexican-style rice by cooking it with tomatoes, garlic, and cumin. Set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the beans:</strong> Warm the pinto or black beans in a small pot over low heat. You can also mash them slightly if you prefer a smoother texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm the tortillas:</strong> Warm the flour tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave for a few seconds until they’re pliable and easy to fold.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Burritos</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Layer the ingredients:</strong> Lay a warmed tortilla on a flat surface. Start with a layer of rice in the center of the tortilla. Then add the carne asada, beans, shredded cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa or pico de gallo, diced tomatoes, and any additional toppings like jalapeños, cilantro, and lettuce.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold the burrito:</strong> Fold the sides of the tortilla over the filling, then fold the bottom up and roll it tightly from the bottom to the top, tucking in the sides as you go to create a tight, compact burrito.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 5: Optional – Grill the Burrito</h3>
    <p><strong>Crisp the burrito:</strong> For extra texture, heat a skillet over medium heat and place the rolled burrito seam-side down. Cook for 1-2 minutes on each side until the tortilla is golden and crisp.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
    <p><strong>Cut in half:</strong> Serve the burrito as is or cut it in half for easier eating. You can also serve with extra salsa, guacamole, or hot sauce on the side.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Custom fillings:</strong> Mission burritos are highly customizable. You can add or swap ingredients like refried beans, grilled vegetables, or different meats such as chicken or carnitas.</li>
        <li><strong>Rice and beans:</strong> The combination of rice and beans gives the burrito its hearty texture, making it more filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Large tortillas:</strong> Use extra-large tortillas (12-inch or larger) to accommodate all the fillings and prevent tearing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enjoy this authentic <strong>Mission Burrito</strong> with Mexican-style flavors, a perfect blend of grilled carne asada, savory beans, flavorful rice, and delicious toppings!</p>
