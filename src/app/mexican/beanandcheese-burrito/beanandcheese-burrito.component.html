    <h1>Bean and Cheese Burrito Recipe</h1>
    <p>A <strong>Bean and Cheese Burrito</strong> is a classic Mexican dish that's simple, delicious, and comforting. It features refried beans and melted cheese wrapped in a warm tortilla. Here’s a traditional recipe for a <strong>Mexican Bean and Cheese Burrito</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <h3>For the Burrito Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (15 oz) refried beans (or 2 cups homemade refried beans)</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a Mexican blend)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil (for cooking the beans, if needed)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Assembly:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large flour tortillas (10-12 inch)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salsa or pico de gallo (optional, for serving)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sour cream (optional, for serving)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup guacamole (optional, for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beans</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat the beans:</strong> If using canned refried beans, heat them in a small pot over medium heat. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. If the beans are too thick, add a bit of water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the beans:</strong> Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. If using homemade refried beans, follow the same steps to warm and season them.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Warm the Tortillas</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat the tortillas:</strong> Warm the flour tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side, or microwave them for a few seconds until they are pliable.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Burritos</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Spread the beans:</strong> Place a warmed tortilla on a flat surface. Spread a generous portion of the warm refried beans down the center of the tortilla.</li>
        <li><strong>Add cheese:</strong> Sprinkle shredded cheese over the beans. The heat from the beans will begin to melt the cheese slightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional toppings:</strong> Add chopped cilantro, salsa, or other desired toppings before rolling, if using.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4: Roll the Burritos</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Fold and roll:</strong> Fold the sides of the tortilla over the filling, then fold the bottom up and roll tightly from the bottom to the top to enclose the filling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 5: Optional – Crisp the Burritos</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Grill or pan-fry:</strong> For a crispy texture, heat a skillet over medium heat and place the rolled burritos seam-side down. Cook for 1-2 minutes on each side until the tortilla is golden brown and crisp.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
    <p><strong>Serve hot:</strong> Serve the burritos with additional salsa, sour cream, and guacamole on the side if desired.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Customize your beans:</strong> You can use black beans, pinto beans, or any type of beans you prefer. If using whole beans, mash them slightly before using.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Choose a cheese that melts well for the best texture. Mexican blend cheese or Monterey Jack are great options.</li>
        <li><strong>Tortilla size:</strong> Ensure you use large tortillas to hold all the filling without tearing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This <strong>Bean and Cheese Burrito</strong> is a satisfying and easy-to-make meal that captures the essence of traditional Mexican flavors in a simple and delicious form. Enjoy!</p>
