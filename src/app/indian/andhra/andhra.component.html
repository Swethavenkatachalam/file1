    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="step-title">Step 1: Prepare the Crab Meat</li>
        <ol>
            <li>If using whole crabs, clean them thoroughly by removing the shell, legs, and other inedible parts. For just crab meat, clean it properly and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Boil the crab meat (or crabs) with turmeric powder, salt, and enough water for about 5-7 minutes until lightly cooked. Drain and set aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <li class="step-title">Step 2: Make the Masala Base</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pan or kadhai. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds, and let them splutter.</li>
            <li>Add the curry leaves and sauté for a few seconds until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the finely chopped onions and green chilies. Sauté until the onions turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        </ol>

        <li class="step-title">Step 3: Add the Tomatoes and Spices</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook until they turn soft and the oil starts to separate from the masala.</li>
            <li>Stir in turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, black pepper powder, and salt. Cook the spices on medium heat for 3-4 minutes, allowing them to blend well with the tomatoes and onions.</li>
        </ol>

        <li class="step-title">Step 4: Cook the Crab Meat</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the pre-cooked crab meat (or crabs) to the masala mixture. Stir gently to coat the crab meat with the spicy masala.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan and let it cook on medium heat for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure the crab meat absorbs the flavors of the masala.</li>
            <li>Add garam masala towards the end and mix well.</li>
        </ol>

        <li class="step-title">Step 5: Garnishing and Final Touches</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Add lemon juice and fresh coriander leaves to the crab masala for a tangy and fresh finish.</li>
            <li>Cook for another 2 minutes, then turn off the heat.</li>
        </ol>

        <li class="step-title">Step 6: Serving</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Serve the <strong>Andhra Crab Meat Masala</strong> hot with steamed rice, roti, or appam.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <p>For a spicier flavor, adjust the amount of red chili powder and green chilies.</p>
    <p>If you prefer a thicker gravy, reduce the amount of water used during cooking.</p>
    <p>Whole crabs give the dish a more authentic touch, but you can use just crab meat for convenience.</p>
