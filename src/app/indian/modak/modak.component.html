    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a non-stick pan, heat 1 tablespoon ghee. Add the grated coconut and cook on a low flame for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the grated jaggery to the pan. Stir continuously until the jaggery melts and combines well with the coconut. Cook for another 5 minutes until the mixture thickens.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped nuts and cardamom powder. Mix well and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
        </ol>

        <li><strong>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pan, bring 1 cup water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and 1/2 teaspoon ghee.</li>
            <li>Gradually add 1 cup rice flour to the boiling water, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the mixture starts to come together.</li>
            <li>Remove the dough from the pan and let it cool slightly. Knead the dough while it’s still warm to make it smooth and pliable. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more rice flour.</li>
        </ol>

        <li><strong>Step 3: Shape the Modak</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease your hands or modak molds with a little ghee.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small balls, about the size of a golf ball.</li>
            <li>Flatten each ball into a small disc, about 3-4 inches in diameter, with your fingers or a rolling pin.</li>
            <li>Place a small spoonful of the coconut-jaggery filling in the center of each disc.</li>
            <li>Gather the edges of the disc and pleat them around the filling to form a dumpling shape. Pinch the top to seal. Alternatively, use a modak mold to shape the dumplings.</li>
        </ol>

        <li><strong>Step 4: Steam the Modak</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease the steamer or steaming plates with ghee.</li>
            <li>Arrange the shaped modaks in the steamer, leaving space between them.</li>
            <li>Steam the modaks for 10-12 minutes over medium heat. Check if they are cooked by inserting a toothpick or knife; it should come out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the modaks to cool slightly before serving.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
