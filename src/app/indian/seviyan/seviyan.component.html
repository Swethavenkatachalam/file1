            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1: Roast the Vermicelli</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat 1 tablespoon of ghee over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the seviyan (vermicelli) to the hot ghee.</li>
                    <li>Roast the seviyan, stirring continuously, until it turns golden brown. This should take about 3-4 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
        
                <li><strong>Step 2: Prepare the Milk</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a separate large pan, bring 4 cups of full-fat milk to a boil over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes to slightly thicken. Stir occasionally to prevent the milk from sticking to the bottom.</li>
                </ol>
        
                <li><strong>Step 3: Cook the Seviyan</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the roasted seviyan to the boiling milk.</li>
                    <li>Stir well and cook on low to medium heat for about 10-12 minutes, or until the seviyan is soft and has absorbed some of the milk.</li>
                    <li>Add 1/2 cup sugar and stir until it dissolves completely. If using, add 1/4 cup condensed milk for added richness.</li>
                </ol>
        
                <li><strong>Step 4: Flavor the Kheer</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stir in 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder and the soaked saffron (if using). Mix well.</li>
                    <li>Continue to cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
                </ol>
        
                <li><strong>Step 5: Prepare the Nuts and Raisins</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small pan, heat a little ghee (about 1 tablespoon) and fry the slivered almonds, chopped cashews, and pistachios until golden brown. Add the raisins and cook for another minute.</li>
                    <li>Add this mixture to the kheer and stir well.</li>
                </ol>
        
                <li><strong>Step 6: Final Touches</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>If desired, add a few drops of rose water or kewra water for a subtle floral aroma.</li>
                    <li>Mix well and let the kheer simmer for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
        
                <li><strong>Step 7: Serve</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>*Seviyan Kheer* can be enjoyed hot, warm, or chilled. If serving chilled, allow it to cool to room temperature before refrigerating.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The kheer will thicken as it cools, so keep it slightly runny if you plan to serve it later. You can adjust the consistency with a little warm milk if needed.</li>
                <li>Adjust the sugar according to your taste. The kheer may taste sweeter after chilling if youâ€™re serving it cold.</li>
                <li>For a smoother texture, you can blend a portion of the kheer before adding the nuts. This gives a more uniform consistency.</li>
                <li>Frying the nuts and raisins in ghee enhances their flavor and adds a nice texture to the kheer. Be cautious not to burn them.</li>
