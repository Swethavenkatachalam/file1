        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix all-purpose flour and semolina.</li>
                <li>Gradually add milk and water, stirring continuously to form a smooth batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter.</li>
                <li>Add baking soda, cardamom powder, and ghee. Mix well and let the batter rest for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure there are no lumps in the batter for a smooth texture.</li>
            </ol>

            <li><strong>Step 2: Prepare the Sugar Syrup</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a pan, combine sugar and water. Heat over medium heat until the sugar dissolves completely.</li>
                <li>Add cardamom powder and lemon juice. Cook until the syrup reaches a one-string consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> The lemon juice prevents the syrup from crystallizing.</li>
            </ol>

            <li><strong>Step 3: Fry the Ghevar</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan or kadhai. The oil should be moderately hot.</li>
                <li>Pour a small amount of batter into the hot oil, and it will spread and form a lace-like pattern. Use a ladle or small cup to pour the batter.</li>
                <li>Fry the ghevar until golden brown. Remove it carefully with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> To get the characteristic lace pattern, pour the batter from a height and ensure the oil isn't too hot.</li>
            </ol>

            <li><strong>Step 4: Soak in Sugar Syrup</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Once the ghevar is slightly cooled, dip it into the warm sugar syrup for a few seconds to soak.</li>
                <li>Remove and let it drain on a wire rack or plate.</li>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Donâ€™t soak the ghevar for too long, or it may become too soggy.</li>
            </ol>

            <li><strong>Step 5: Prepare the Malai</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Whip the malai (cream) until smooth and slightly thickened.</li>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> You can add a little sugar to the malai if desired.</li>
            </ol>

            <li><strong>Step 6: Assemble and Garnish</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Spread a layer of whipped malai on top of the soaked ghevar.</li>
                <li>Garnish with chopped nuts, rose petals, and edible silver leaf if using.</li>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Serve immediately or refrigerate for a few hours for a chilled dessert.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips:</h2>
        <p>- The batter should be smooth and slightly runny. Adjust the milk or water to get the right consistency.</p>
        <p>- Maintain a moderate oil temperature for even frying and a lace-like pattern.</p>
        <p>- Malai Ghevar is best enjoyed fresh, but it can be refrigerated for a few days. Just add malai and garnish before serving.</p>
