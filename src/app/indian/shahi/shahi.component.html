                <li><strong>Step 1: Prepare the Milk Mixture</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a saucepan, bring 1 cup full-fat milk to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Add 1/2 cup sugar and stir until it dissolves completely.</li>
                    <li>If using, add 1/4 cup condensed milk to the milk mixture for extra richness.</li>
                    <li>Stir in 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using). Continue to simmer for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add rose water or kewra water (if using) for extra aroma. Mix well and remove from heat.</li>
                </ol>
        
                <li><strong>Step 2: Prepare the Bread</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Trim the crusts from the bread slices if desired.</li>
                    <li>Heat 1/4 cup ghee in a pan. Fry the bread slices until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides. Remove and drain excess ghee on paper towels.</li>
                </ol>
        
                <li><strong>Step 3: Assemble the Shahi Tukda</strong></li>
                <ol>

                    <li>Pour the prepared milk mixture over the fried bread slices, ensuring they are well soaked.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with chopped nuts and, if using, silver leaf.</li>
                </ol>
        
                <li><strong>Step 4: Chill and Serve</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Allow the Shahi Tukda to sit for at least 30 minutes to soak in the milk and flavors. It can be served warm or chilled.</li>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Using slightly stale bread helps it absorb the milk mixture better. Fresh bread can become too soggy.</li>
                <li>Fry the bread slices in ghee for a rich flavor. If you prefer a lighter version, you can use oil.</li>
                <li>Adjust the sweetness of the milk mixture to your taste. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little more milk.</li>
                <li>Allowing the Shahi Tukda to sit for a while helps the bread absorb the milk mixture fully and develop a better texture.</li>
